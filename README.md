# NBA Player Efficiency Machine Learning Project
This project, originally developed in collaboration with Carli Kelley and Garner Hasler, focuses on predicting NBA players' Player Efficiency Ratings (PER) using machine learning techniques.
The original codebase and initial analysis were co-authored, and I have been granted permission to host a copy of the work here on my GitHub to showcase and continue iterating on the project. This version may include updates, refinements, or extensions that reflect my personal contributions and learning.
